   run in pedantic mode if the uses are carefully marked using the
   `__extension__' keyword.  But this is not generally available before
   version 2.8.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above allow passing all anonymous arguments of an
   __extern_always_inline function to some other vararg function.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  Using __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__
   or __GNUC_GNU_INLINE is not a good enough check for gcc because gcc versions
   older than 4.3 may define these macros and still not guarantee GNU inlining
   semantics.

   clang++ identifies itself as gcc-4.2, but has support for GNU inlining
   semantics, that can be checked fot by using the __GNUC_STDC_INLINE_ and
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ macro definitions.  *//* Associate error messages with the source location of the call site rather
   than with the source location inside the function.  *//* Forces a function to be always inlined.  *//* empty *//* If fortification mode, we warn about unused results of certain
   function calls which can lead to problems.  *//* The nonull function attribute allows to mark pointer parameters which
   must not be NULL.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.97 development the `strfmon' format
   attribute for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it
   unconditionally (although this would be possible) since it
   generates warnings.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.8 development the `format_arg' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.
   If several `format_arg' attributes are given for the same function, in
   gcc-3.0 and older, all but the last one are ignored.  In newer gccs,
   all designated arguments are considered.  *//* gcc allows marking deprecated functions.  *//* At some point during the gcc 3.1 development the `used' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* This declaration tells the compiler that the value is constant.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `pure' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `malloc' attribute

# define __REDIRECT(name, proto, alias) name proto; \

*//* __asm__ ("xyz") is used throughout the headers to rename functions
   at the assembly language level.  This is wrapped by the __REDIRECT
   macro, in order to support compilers that can do this some other
   way.  When compilers don't support asm-names at all, we have to do
   preprocessor tricks instead (which don't have exactly the right
   semantics, but it's the best we can do).

   Example:
   int __REDIRECT(setpgrp, (__pid_t pid, __pid_t pgrp), setpgid); *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  Approximate with [1].  *//* GCC 2.97 supports C99 flexible array members.  *//* Support for flexible arrays.  *//* Fortify support.  *//* nothing *//* Support for bounded pointers.  *//* For compatibility we do not add the declarations into any
   namespace.  They will end up in the global namespace which is what
   old code expects.  *//* The standard library needs the functions from the ISO C90 standard
   in the std namespace.  At the same time we want to be safe for
   future changes and we include the ISO C99 code in the non-standard
   namespace __c99.  The C++ wrapper header take case of adding the
   definitions to the global namespace.  *//* C++ needs to know that types and declarations are C, not C++.  *//* This is not a typedef so `const __ptr_t' does the right thing.  *//* For these things, GCC behaves the ANSI way normally,
   and the non-ANSI way under -traditional.  *//* These two macros are not used in glibc anymore.  They are kept here
   only because some other projects expect the macros to be defined.  *//* GCC.  *//* No inline functions.  *//* Not GCC.  *//* GCC can always grok prototypes.  For C++ programs we add throw()
   to help it optimize the function calls.  But this works only with
   gcc 2.8.x and egcs.  For gcc 3.2 and up we even mark C functions
   as non-throwing using a function attribute since programs can use
   the -fexceptions options for C code as well.  *//* All functions, except those with callbacks or those that
   synchronize memory, are leaf functions.  *//* Some user header file might have defined this before.  *//* The GNU libc does not support any K&R compilers or the traditional mode
   of ISO C compilers anymore.  Check for some of the combinations not
   anymore supported.  *//* We are almost always included from features.h. *//* Copyright (C) 1992-2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _BSD_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and 4.3BSD things.
   _SVID_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and SVID things.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _REENTRANT		Select additionally reentrant object.
   _THREAD_SAFE		Same as _REENTRANT, often used by other systems.
   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	If set to numeric value > 0 additional security
			measures are defined, according to level.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler defines __STRICT_ANSI__.
   If none of these are defined, the default is to have _SVID_SOURCE,
   _BSD_SOURCE, and _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200112L.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.
   For example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE
   together give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_BSD		Define 4.3BSD things.
   __USE_SVID		Define SVID things.
   __USE_MISC		Define things common to BSD and System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_REENTRANT	Define reentrant/thread-safe *_r functions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.
   __FAVOR_BSD		Favor 4.3BSD things in cases of conflict.

   *  @defgroup io I/O
   *
   *  Nearly all of the I/O classes are parameterized on the type of
   *  characters they read and write.  (The major exception is ios_base at
   *  the top of the hierarchy.)  This is a change from pre-Standard
   *  streams, which were not templates.
   *
   *  For ease of use and compatibility, all of the basic_* I/O-related
   *  classes are given typedef names for both of the builtin character
   *  widths (wide and narrow).  The typedefs are the same as the
   *  pre-Standard names, for example:
   *
   *  @code
   *     typedef basic_ifstream<char>  ifstream;
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Because properly forward-declaring these classes can be difficult, you
   *  should not do it yourself.  Instead, include the &lt;iosfwd&gt;
   *  header, which contains only declarations of all the I/O classes as
   *  well as the typedefs.  Trying to forward-declare the typedefs
   *  themselves (e.g., <code>class ostream;</code>) is not valid ISO C++.

   *  Bidirectional and random access iterators have corresponding reverse

   *  opposite direction.  They have the same signatures as the corresponding
   *  iterators.  The fundamental relation between a reverse %iterator and its
   *  corresponding %iterator @c i is established by the identity:
   *  @code
   *      &*(reverse_iterator(i)) == &*(i - 1)
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  <em>This mapping is dictated by the fact that while there is always a
   *  pointer past the end of an array, there might not be a valid pointer
   *  before the beginning of an array.</em> [24.4.1]/1,2
   *
   *  Reverse iterators can be tricky and surprising at first.  Their

   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, always long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  *//* quad_t is also 64 bits.  *//* Fixed-size types, underlying types depend on word size and compiler.  *//* Convenience types.  *//*
 * Never include this file directly; use <sys/types.h> instead.
 *//* bits/types.h -- definitions of __*_t types underlying *_t types.

   The declarations here must match those in localeinfo.h.

   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale' in <locale.h>)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  *//* ! _ISbit  *//* Alphanumeric.  *//* Punctuation.  *//* Control character.  *//* Blank (usually SPC and TAB).  *//* Graphical.  *//* Printing.  *//* Whitespace.  *//* Hexadecimal numeric.  *//* Numeric.  *//* Alphabetic.  *//* lowercase.  *//* UPPERCASE.  *//* __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN *//* These are all the characteristics of characters.
   If there get to be more than 16 distinct characteristics,
   many things must be changed that use `unsigned short int's.

   The characteristics are stored always in network byte order (big
   endian).  We define the bit value interpretations here dependent on the
   machine's byte order.  *//*

   cancellation.  *//* Remove a cleanup handler installed by the matching pthread_cleanup_push.
   If EXECUTE is non-zero, the handler function is called. *//* Install a cleanup handler: ROUTINE will be called with arguments ARG
   when the thread is canceled or calls pthread_exit.  ROUTINE will also
   be called with arguments ARG when the matching pthread_cleanup_pop
   is executed with non-zero EXECUTE argument.

   pthread_cleanup_push and pthread_cleanup_pop are macros and must always
   be used in matching pairs at the same nesting level of braces.  *//* Function called to call the cleanup handler.  As an extern inline
   function the compiler is free to decide inlining the change when

   Note that these functions are explicitly not marked to not throw an
   exception in C++ code.  If cancellation is implemented by unwinding
   this is necessary to have the compiler generate the unwind information.  *//* Guarantee that the initialization function INIT_ROUTINE will be called
   only once, even if pthread_once is executed several times with the
   same ONCE_CONTROL argument. ONCE_CONTROL must point to a static or
   extern variable initialized to PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT.

   The initialization functions might throw exception which is why
   this function is not marked with __THROW.  *//* Functions for handling initialization.  *//* Get bit set in CPUSET representing the processors TH can run on.  *//* Limit specified thread TH to run only on the processors represented
   in CPUSET.  *//* Yield the processor to another thread or process.
   This function is similar to the POSIX `sched_yield' function but
   might be differently implemented in the case of a m-on-n thread
   implementation.  *//* Set new concurrency level to LEVEL.  *//* Determine level of concurrency.  *//* Set thread name visible in the kernel and its interfaces.  *//* Get thread name visible in the kernel and its interfaces.  *//* Set the scheduling priority for TARGET_THREAD.  *//* Return in *POLICY and *PARAM the scheduling parameters for TARGET_THREAD. *//* Set the scheduling parameters for TARGET_THREAD according to POLICY
   and *PARAM.  *//* Functions for scheduling control.  *//* Initialize thread attribute *ATTR with attributes corresponding to the
   already running thread TH.  It shall be called on uninitialized ATTR
   and destroyed with pthread_attr_destroy when no longer needed.  *//* Get bit set in CPUSET representing the processors threads created with
   ATTR can run on.  *//* Thread created with attribute ATTR will be limited to run only on
   the processors represented in CPUSET.  *//* The following two interfaces are intended to replace the last two.  They
   require setting the address as well as the size since only setting the
   address will make the implementation on some architectures impossible.  *//* Return the previously set address for the stack.  *//* Add information about the minimum stack size needed for the thread
   to be started.  This size must never be less than PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
   and must also not exceed the system limits.  *//* Return the currently used minimal stack size.  *//* Set the starting address of the stack of the thread to be created.
   Depending on whether the stack grows up or down the value must either
   be higher or lower than all the address in the memory block.  The
   minimal size of the block must be PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.  *//* Set scheduling contention scope in *ATTR according to SCOPE.  *//* Return in *SCOPE the scheduling contention scope of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling inheritance mode in *ATTR according to INHERIT.  *//* Return in *INHERIT the scheduling inheritance mode of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling policy in *ATTR according to POLICY.  *//* Return in *POLICY the scheduling policy of *ATTR.  *//* Set scheduling parameters (priority, etc) in *ATTR according to PARAM.  *//* Return in *PARAM the scheduling parameters of *ATTR.  *//* Set the size of the guard area created for stack overflow protection.  *//* Get the size of the guard area created for stack overflow protection.  *//* Set detach state attribute.  *//* Get detach state attribute.  *//* Destroy thread attribute *ATTR.  *//* Initialize thread attribute *ATTR with default attributes
   (detachstate is PTHREAD_JOINABLE, scheduling policy is SCHED_OTHER,
    no user-provided stack).  *//* Thread attribute handling.  *//* Compare two thread identifiers.  *//* Obtain the identifier of the current thread.  *//* Indicate that the thread TH is never to be joined with PTHREAD_JOIN.
   The resources of TH will therefore be freed immediately when it
   terminates, instead of waiting for another thread to perform PTHREAD_JOIN
   on it.  *//* Make calling thread wait for termination of the thread TH, but only
   until TIMEOUT.  The exit status of the thread is stored in
   *THREAD_RETURN, if THREAD_RETURN is not NULL.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Check whether thread TH has terminated.  If yes return the status of
   the thread in *THREAD_RETURN, if THREAD_RETURN is not NULL.  *//* Make calling thread wait for termination of the thread TH.  The
   exit status of the thread is stored in *THREAD_RETURN, if THREAD_RETURN
   is not NULL.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Terminate calling thread.

   The registered cleanup handlers are called via exception handling
   so we cannot mark this function with __THROW.*//* Create a new thread, starting with execution of START-ROUTINE

   calls in shared flavors of the HP-UX C library.  Most of the stubs
   have no functionality.  The details are described in the "libc cumulative
   patch" for each subversion of HP-UX 11.  There are two special interfaces
   provided for checking whether an application is linked to a shared pthread
   library or not.  However, these interfaces aren't available in early
   libpthread libraries.  We also need a test that works for archive
   libraries.  We can't use pthread_once as some libc versions call the
   init function.  We also can't use pthread_create or pthread_attr_init
   as these create a thread and thereby prevent changing the default stack
   size.  The function pthread_default_stacksize_np is available in both
   the archive and shared versions of libpthread.   It can be used to
   determine the default pthread stack size.  There is a stub in some
   shared libc versions which returns a zero size if pthreads are not
   active.  We provide an equivalent stub to handle cases where libc
   doesn't provide one.  *//* not __GXX_WEAK__ *//* FreeBSD or Solaris *//* For a program to be multi-threaded the only thing that it certainly must
   be using is pthread_create.  However, there may be other libraries that
   intercept pthread_create with their own definitions to wrap pthreads
   functionality for some purpose.  In those cases, pthread_create being
   defined might not necessarily mean that libpthread is actually linked
   in.

   For the GNU C library, we can use a known internal name.  This is always
   available in the ABI, but no other library would define it.  That is
   ideal, since any public pthread function might be intercepted just as
   pthread_create might be.  __pthread_key_create is an "internal"
   implementation symbol, but it is part of the public exported ABI.  Also,
   it's among the symbols that the static libpthread.a always links in
   whenever pthread_create is used, so there is no danger of a false
   negative result in any statically-linked, multi-threaded program.

   For others, we choose pthread_cancel as a function that seems unlikely
   to be redefined by an interceptor library.  The bionic (Android) C
   library does not provide pthread_cancel, so we do use pthread_create
   there (and interceptor libraries lose).  *//* neither FreeBSD nor Solaris *//* Make sure we'll never enter this block again.  *//* If this really is a threaded program, then we must ensure that
	     __gthread_active has been set to 1 before exiting this block.  *//* This test is not protected to avoid taking a lock on the main code
     path so every update of __gthread_active in a threaded program must
     be atomic with regard to the result of the test.  *//* On Solaris 2.6 up to 9, the libc exposes a POSIX threads interface even if
   -pthreads is not specified.  The functions are dummies and most return an
   error value.  However pthread_once returns 0 without invoking the routine
   it is passed so we cannot pretend that the interface is active if -pthreads
   is not specified.  On Solaris 2.5.1, the interface is not exposed at all so
   we need to play the usual game with weak symbols.  On Solaris 10 and up, a
   working interface is always exposed.  On FreeBSD 6 and later, libc also
   exposes a dummy POSIX threads interface, similar to what Solaris 2.6 up
   to 9 does.  FreeBSD >= 700014 even provides a pthread_cancel stub in libc,
   which means the alternate __gthread_active_p below cannot be used there.  *//* _LIBOBJC || _LIBOBJC_WEAK *//* Objective-C.  *//* Typically, __gthrw_foo is a weak reference to symbol foo.  *//* POSIX like conditional variables are supported.  Please look at comments
   in gthr.h for details. *//* POSIX threads specific definitions.
   Easy, since the interface is just one-to-one mapping.  *//* Copyright (C) 1997-2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast

		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     void *__gthread_getspecific (__gthread_key_t key)

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   Types:
     __gthread_t
     __gthread_time_t

   *  Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors
   *  with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later.
   *  For example, a variable @c B of type @c binder1st is constructed
   *  from a functor @c f and an argument @c x. Later, B's @c
   *  operator() is called with a single argument @c y. The return
   *  value is the value of @c f(x,y). @c B can be @a called with
   *  various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call @c
   *  f(x,y1), @c f(x,y2), ...
   *
   *  The function @c bind1st is provided to save some typing. It takes the
   *  function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of
   *  @c binder1st.
   *
   *  The type @c binder2nd and its creator function @c bind2nd do the same
   *  thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead
   *  of the first, e.g., @c bind2nd(std::minus<float>(),1.3) will create a
   *  functor whose @c operator() accepts a floating-point number, subtracts
   *  1.3 from it, and returns the result. (If @c bind1st had been used,
   *  the functor would perform <em>1.3 - x</em> instead.
   *
   *  Creator-wrapper functions like @c bind1st are intended to be used in
   *  calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects.
   *  (The goal is to not require you to type names like
   *  @c std::binder1st<std::plus<int>> for declaring a variable to hold the
   *  return value from @c bind1st(std::plus<int>(),5).
   *
   *  These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.
   *

   * @ingroup functors
   *
   *  The advantage of function objects over pointers to functions is that
   *  the objects in the standard library declare nested typedefs describing
   *  their argument and result types with uniform names (e.g., @c result_type
   *  from the base classes @c unary_function and @c binary_function).
   *  Sometimes those typedefs are required, not just optional.
   *
   *  Adaptors are provided to turn pointers to unary (single-argument) and
   *  binary (double-argument) functions into function objects.  The
   *  long-winded functor @c pointer_to_unary_function is constructed with a
   *  function pointer @c f, and its @c operator() called with argument @c x
   *  returns @c f(x).  The functor @c pointer_to_binary_function does the same
   *  thing, but with a double-argument @c f and @c operator().
   *
   *  The function @c ptr_fun takes a pointer-to-function @c f and constructs
   *  an instance of the appropriate functor.

   *
   *  The functions @c not1 and @c not2 each take a predicate functor
   *  and return an instance of @c unary_negate or
   *  @c binary_negate, respectively.  These classes are functors whose
   *  @c operator() performs the stored predicate function and then returns
   *  the negation of the result.
   *
   *  For example, given a vector of integers and a trivial predicate,
   *  \code
   *  struct IntGreaterThanThree
   *    : public std::unary_function<int, bool>
   *  {
   *      bool operator() (int x) { return x > 3; }
   *  };
   *
   *  std::find_if (v.begin(), v.end(), not1(IntGreaterThanThree()));
   *  \endcode
   *  The call to @c find_if will locate the first index (i) of @c v for which
   *  <code>!(v[i] > 3)</code> is true.
   *
   *  The not1/unary_negate combination works on predicates taking a single
   *  argument.  The not2/binary_negate combination works on predicates which
   *  take two arguments.

   *
   *  Function objects, or @e functors, are objects with an @c operator()
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to @a functors, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors @c a and @c b containing @c double,
   *  and put the result in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in @c a, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will be inlined directly.
   *
   *  The standard functors are derived from structs named @c unary_function
   *  and @c binary_function.  These two classes contain nothing but typedefs,
   *  to aid in generic (template) programming.  If you write your own
   *  functors, you might consider doing the same.

   *  Documentation?  What's that?
   *  Nathan Myers <ncm@cantrip.org>.
   *
   *  A string looks like this:
   *
   *  @code
   *                                        [_Rep]
   *                                        _M_length
   *   [basic_string<char_type>]            _M_capacity
   *   _M_dataplus                          _M_refcount
   *   _M_p ---------------->               unnamed array of char_type
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Where the _M_p points to the first character in the string, and
   *  you cast it to a pointer-to-_Rep and subtract 1 to get a
   *  pointer to the header.
   *
   *  This approach has the enormous advantage that a string object
   *  requires only one allocation.  All the ugliness is confined
   *  within a single %pair of inline functions, which each compile to
   *  a single @a add instruction: _Rep::_M_data(), and
   *  string::_M_rep(); and the allocation function which gets a
   *  block of raw bytes and with room enough and constructs a _Rep
   *  object at the front.
   *
   *  The reason you want _M_data pointing to the character %array and
   *  not the _Rep is so that the debugger can see the string
   *  contents. (Probably we should add a non-inline member to get
   *  the _Rep for the debugger to use, so users can check the actual
   *  string length.)
   *
   *  Note that the _Rep object is a POD so that you can have a
   *  static <em>empty string</em> _Rep object already @a constructed before
   *  static constructors have run.  The reference-count encoding is
   *  chosen so that a 0 indicates one reference, so you never try to
   *  destroy the empty-string _Rep object.
   *
   *  All but the last paragraph is considered pretty conventional
   *  for a C++ string implementation.

   *
   *  This is a base class.  Derived stream buffers each control a
   *  pair of character sequences:  one for input, and one for output.
   *
   *  Section [27.5.1] of the standard describes the requirements and
   *  behavior of stream buffer classes.  That section (three paragraphs)
   *  is reproduced here, for simplicity and accuracy.
   *
   *  -# Stream buffers can impose various constraints on the sequences
   *     they control.  Some constraints are:
   *     - The controlled input sequence can be not readable.
   *     - The controlled output sequence can be not writable.
   *     - The controlled sequences can be associated with the contents of
   *       other representations for character sequences, such as external
   *       files.
   *     - The controlled sequences can support operations @e directly to or
   *       from associated sequences.
   *     - The controlled sequences can impose limitations on how the
   *       program can read characters from a sequence, write characters to
   *       a sequence, put characters back into an input sequence, or alter
   *       the stream position.
   *     .
   *  -# Each sequence is characterized by three pointers which, if non-null,
   *     all point into the same @c charT array object.  The array object
   *     represents, at any moment, a (sub)sequence of characters from the
   *     sequence.  Operations performed on a sequence alter the values
   *     stored in these pointers, perform reads and writes directly to or
   *     from associated sequences, and alter <em>the stream position</em> and
   *     conversion state as needed to maintain this subsequence relationship.
   *     The three pointers are:
   *     - the <em>beginning pointer</em>, or lowest element address in the
   *       array (called @e xbeg here);
   *     - the <em>next pointer</em>, or next element address that is a
   *       current candidate for reading or writing (called @e xnext here);
   *     - the <em>end pointer</em>, or first element address beyond the
   *       end of the array (called @e xend here).
   *     .
   *  -# The following semantic constraints shall always apply for any set
   *     of three pointers for a sequence, using the pointer names given
   *     immediately above:
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer, then @e xbeg and @e xend shall
   *       also be non-null pointers into the same @c charT array, as
   *       described above; otherwise, @e xbeg and @e xend shall also be null.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext < @e xend for an
   *       output sequence, then a <em>write position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall be assignable as the next element
   *       to write (to put, or to store a character value, into the sequence).
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xbeg < @e xnext for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>putback position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e xnext[-1] shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next (preceding) element to store a character that is put back
   *       into the input sequence.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext< @e xend for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>read position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next element to read (to get, or to obtain a character value,
   *       from the sequence).
